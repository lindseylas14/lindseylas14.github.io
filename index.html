	<h1>Book Review By: Lindsey Stephens</h1>
	<h2><i>Romeo and Juliet</i></h2>
	<h3> Description</h3>
	<p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is a <strong>fascinating</strong> story of two people with a <em>forbidden</em> love for each other. It is a <mark>dramatic tale</mark> of feuding families, love, and loss. Throughout the story, we meet enticing characters with different backgrounds and motives that make the story into the classic that it has become. The two main characters, Romeo and Juliet, show us what it means to be <small>young</small> and in love, with what seems like the whole world against them. Overall, it is a great story that everyone should read because of its underlying message of love. I recommend it 10<sup>10</sup> times over because this classic is as necessary as H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
